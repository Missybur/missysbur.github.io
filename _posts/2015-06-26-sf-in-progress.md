SF-IN-PROGRESS is a project that I partipated in helping make for CODE FOR AMERICA.  This project recieved 3rd Place for "The National Day of Civic Hacking 2015".  This is on on going project that my team and I work on in order to raise awareness regarding the housing situation in San Francisco and allow people to see when and where the Civic Hearings will be held for buildings and their residents that are in threat of being evicted.
