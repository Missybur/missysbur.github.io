Global-Giving is a project that my team and I worked on for the "AT&T VR Mobile Hackathon 2015".  Global-Giving is a VR application which allows users to engage with when wearing the "Samsung Gear VR" devices and view people around the world who are in need of financial aid or assistance.  Users are able to view the progress or current status of someone's situation so they can see first hand the progress that has been made via their generous donations or areas that people around the world are still in need of help.  I continue to work with my team on this project and we hope to one day make this project into a reality that others from around the world will be able to benefit from.

Our team was very proud and happy to hear that this project won 2nd Place at the Hackathon and we were given a "Coding House" Scholarship.
